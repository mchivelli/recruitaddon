## üéÆ How to Use

### Basic Commands

All commands work at **unlimited distance** - no need to be near your recruits!

#### March Commands
```
/recruits march <x> <y> <z> [group <groupId>] [formation <type>]
```
- **Basic**: `/recruits march 100 64 -200` - March all recruits to coordinates
- **Group**: `/recruits march 0 64 0 group 1` - March only group 1
- **Formation**: `/recruits march 50 70 -100 formation LINE` - March in line formation
- **Advanced**: `/recruits march -50 80 150 group 2 formation SQUARE` - Group 2 in square formation

#### Raid Commands
```
/recruits raid <x> <y> <z> [group <groupId>] [formation <type>]
```
- **Basic**: `/recruits raid -100 65 300` - Send recruits to raid coordinates
- **Group**: `/recruits raid 200 70 -50 group 3` - Send group 3 to raid
- **Formation**: `/recruits raid 0 64 -200 formation WEDGE` - Raid in wedge formation

#### Control Commands
```
/recruits cancel     # Cancel all operations, recruits return to you
/recruits stop       # Make recruits hold defensive positions with shields
/recruits follow [player] [formation]  # Follow you or another player
/recruits attack <player>  # Attack a specific player (max 125 blocks)
```

### Formation Types

- **LINE** - Single line formation, perfect for narrow passages
- **SQUARE** - Grid formation, balanced defense and offense
- **CIRCLE** - Circular formation, excellent for area defense
- **WEDGE** - V-shaped formation, ideal for breakthrough attacks

### Coordinate System

**Absolute Coordinates**: Use exact numbers
```
/recruits march 100 64 -200
```

**Relative Coordinates**: Use `~` for relative positioning
```
/recruits march ~ ~5 ~10    # 5 blocks up, 10 blocks forward from your position
/recruits march ~-20 ~ ~    # 20 blocks to the left of your position
```

## üéõÔ∏è GUI Features

### Enhanced Recruit Command GUI

Access through the existing Recruits mod interface to find new "Group Commands" section:

**Quick Action Buttons:**
- **March Here** - Send active groups to your crosshair target
- **Raid Here** - Send active groups to raid your crosshair target
- **Cancel** - Instantly recall all recruits to you
- **Stop** - Make recruits hold defensive positions

**Chat Prefill Buttons:**
- **March to...** - Prefills `/recruits march group X ~ ~ ~` for easy editing
- **Raid at...** - Prefills `/recruits raid group X ~ ~ ~` for easy editing

*Note: Buttons automatically detect your active recruit groups and target them specifically.*

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Features

### March vs Raid Behavior

**March Mode (Defensive)**:
- Recruits move to destination in neutral state
- Will defend if attacked but continue mission
- Maintains formation during movement
- Suitable for repositioning and defensive movements

**Raid Mode (Aggressive)**:
- Two-phase operation: March ‚Üí Raid
- Recruits march to destination, then become aggressive
- Attacks hostile mobs and players at destination
- Respects entity blacklist configuration

### Group Retaliation System

When any recruit in a marching group is attacked:
1. **Entire group** immediately targets the attacker
2. Group coordinates to eliminate the threat
3. After 5 seconds, automatically **resumes original march**
4. You receive notifications about the engagement

### Defensive Commands

**Stop Command**:
- Recruits raise shields and enter guard mode
- Only retaliate when directly attacked
- Multiple shield activation methods ensure reliability
- Perfect for holding strategic positions

**Cancel Command**:
- Comprehensive AI state clearing
- Multiple pathfinding methods ensure recruits return
- Cancels any active raid missions
- Robust error handling prevents failures

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration file: `config/recruits-addon.toml` (auto-generated on first run)

### Key Settings

```toml
[commands]
# Maximum distance for attack commands (blocks)
attackCommandMaxDistance = 125
# Minimum distance required for follow commands (blocks) 
followCommandMinDistance = 50

[raids]
# Enable raid notifications
enableRaidNotifications = true
# Notify when recruits reach raid destination
notifyOnDestinationReached = true
# Notify when recruits engage in combat
notifyOnCombatStart = true

[blacklist]
# Protect villagers from raid attacks
blacklistVillagers = true
# Protect pets from raid attacks
blacklistPets = true
# Prevent recruits from attacking creepers (explosion protection)
blacklistCreepers = true
```

### Entity Blacklist

Customize which entities recruits should avoid during raids:
```toml
[blacklist.entities]
entityBlacklist = [
    "minecraft:villager",
    "minecraft:iron_golem", 
    "minecraft:cat",
    "minecraft:wolf",
    "minecraft:creeper"
]
```

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Recruits not responding to commands**
- Ensure recruits are actually owned by you
- Check that groups are not disabled in the GUI
- Verify recruits are not stuck or in combat

**Q: GUI buttons not working**
- Make sure you have active recruit groups
- Check that recruits are alive and not disabled
- Restart the GUI if buttons appear grayed out

**Q: Distance limitations**
- This mod removes ALL distance limitations
- Commands work from anywhere in the world
- If recruits seem unresponsive, they may be in unloaded chunks

**Q: Recruits not raising shields on stop**
- The mod tries multiple methods to activate shields
- Ensure recruits have shields equipped
- Some recruit types may not support shield mechanics
